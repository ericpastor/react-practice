# Follow Card

This practice is based on the follow-card repository of the course taught by midudev [aprendiendo-react-01](https://github.com/midudev/aprendiendo-react/blob/master/projects/01-twitter-follow-card/src/App.jsx), but adding concepts and putting them into practice in the project.

- Differences from the original:
    - Fetching random users from the api: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=6
    - Custom Hook
    - Components

- Most relevant concepts: 

    Components, Props, useState, useEffect, Custom Hooks, Objects with Spread Operator, CSS, FlexBox and Grid
