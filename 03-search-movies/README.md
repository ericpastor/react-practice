## Trainee/Junior technical interview

Based on Technical test for React Juniors and Trainees from 'midudev', original code: [here](https://github.com/midudev/aprendiendo-react/tree/master/projects/05-react-buscador-peliculas)

Create an application to find movies

API to use: - https://www.omdbapi.com/ Get the API Key on the website itself by registering your email.

- Requirements:

   - You need to show an input to search for the movie and a button to search.

   - List the movies and show the title, year and poster.

   - Make the form work

   - Make the movies show in a responsive grid.

   - Fetch data to the API

- First iteration:

  - Avoid doing the same search twice in a row.

  - Have the search done automatically when typing.

  - Prevent the search from being done continuously when typing (debounce)

<hr>

Fixed error from the original code: Uncaught TypeError: movies is not iterable ðŸ‘‰ when empty input and sort check box activated.

[...movies].sort((a, b) => a.title.localeCompare(b.title)) <br>
ðŸ‘‡ <br>
movies && [...movies].sort((a, b) => a.title.localeCompare(b.title))

<hr>
